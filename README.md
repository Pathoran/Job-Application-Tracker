# Job-Application-Tracker
A job application tracking program that helps users track their job applications and networking contacts.

Users can input information about their job applications, including the job title, company name, and application status. The application can then automatically send follow-up emails based on the user's input.

Users can also log who they networked with and set reminders to touch base with connections.
